Every Tuesday except the 2nd Tuesday of the month and the last Tuesday of the month. 5 to 8 pm.

Our next meeting is on [Tuesday 1/17/2017 at FastModel Sports](https://www.meetup.com/PeerLabChicago/events/236801972/).

### What is Peer Lab Chicago?

Here's the idea: come join other developers for a peer-based collaborative learning lab. You've got a question? Maybe someone can provide you with some insight. Maybe you can help someone else with their questions. Bring a laptop and some code to work on. While we expect most of the attendees to be iOS developers, all developers are welcome. Sometimes a fresh perspective can be helpful. Either way, we can learn a lot from each other.

### Do I need to sign up anywhere?

You don't **have to**, but I would appreciate it if you joined our [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/PeerLabChicago/) and let me know if you're planning on attending.

### We've already got CocoaHeads and NSCoder Chicago. Why have yet another meetup?

The goal is to have an environment where people can 

- work
- bounce ideas off others
- ask for help
- offer help to others 

I don't want to duplicate the work that NSCoder Chicago and CocoaHeads are doing. Therefore we won't do things like have short or long-form talks or presentations. Think of this as office hours for yourself and your friends.  A place where you know you can go to when you want a place to work, or seek help.

### Do you have a Code of Conduct?

Yes. We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/) code of conduct. 

### Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
