Every Tuesday except the 2nd Tuesday of the month and the last Tuesday of the month. <br>
5pm to 8 pm.

<b>Our next meeting is on [Tuesday 2/7/2017 5pm - 8pm at FastModel Sports](https://www.meetup.com/PeerLabChicago/events/237001083/).</b>

### What is Peer Lab Chicago?

This is one of many [Peer Lab communities](http://peerlab.community). Here's the idea: come join other developers for a peer-based collaborative learning lab. You've got a question? Maybe someone can provide you with some insight. Maybe you can help someone else with their questions. Bring a laptop and some code to work on. While we expect most of the attendees to be iOS developers, all developers are welcome. Sometimes a fresh perspective can be helpful. Either way, we can learn a lot from each other.

### Do I need to sign up anywhere?

You don't **have to**, but I would appreciate it if you joined our [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/PeerLabChicago/) and let me know if you're planning on attending.

### We've already got CocoaHeads and NSCoder Chicago. Why have yet another meetup?

The goal is to have an environment where people can 

- work
- bounce ideas off others
- ask for help
- offer help to others 

I don't want to duplicate the work that CocoaHeads and NSCoder Chicago are doing. Therefore we won't do things like have short or long-form talks or presentations. In fact we don't meet on days that would conflict with these two meetups, because that's where we'll be on those days. Think of Peer Lab Chicago as office hours for yourself and your friends.  A place where you know you can go to when you want a place to work, or seek help. 

### Do you have a Code of Conduct?

Yes. Our code of conduct is available at [http://peerlabchicago.com/cc](http://peerlabchicago.com/cc).

### Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.

You can find us on Twitter at [@peerLabChicago](https://twitter.com/peerlabchicago).

### I'm not in Chicago. Is there a Peer Lab near me?

There is a list of labs at [peerlab.community](http://peerlab.community). On that site you can also learn more about Peer Labs and find out how to start your own.
