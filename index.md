Every Tuesday except the 2nd Tuesday of the month and the last Tuesday of the month. <br>
5pm to 8 pm.

<b>Our next meeting is on [Tuesday 10/3/2017 5pm - 8pm at FastModel Sports](https://www.meetup.com/PeerLabChicago/events/243516278/).</b>

**Please note our new address. We're now at 444 N. Michigan Ave (2 doors north of our old location). Suite 760. This is the building with the Starbucks.** Once you enter the building, sign in at the Security Desk. They will direct you to an elevator that will take you to the 7th floor. Once you get off the elevator, look left and right. On one side you'll see our neighbor's office. On the other side there is a window through which you can see a building with black bricks. Walk towards that window and then take a right to get to Suite 760.

### What is Peer Lab Chicago?

This is one of many [Peer Lab communities](http://peerlab.community). Here's the idea: come join other developers for a peer-based collaborative learning lab. You've got a question? Maybe someone can provide you with some insight. Maybe you can help someone else with their questions. Bring a laptop and some code to work on. While we expect most of the attendees to be iOS developers, all developers are welcome. Sometimes a fresh perspective can be helpful. Either way, we can learn a lot from each other.

### Do I need to sign up anywhere?

Yes. Please sign in on our [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/PeerLabChicago/) and let me know if you're planning on attending. This way I can give your name to Security so they can let you in. Please bring some sort of ID with you so Security can match you with the signup sheet.

### We've already got CocoaHeads and NSCoder Chicago. Why have yet another meetup?

The goal is to have an environment where people can 

- work
- bounce ideas off others
- ask for help
- offer help to others 

I don't want to duplicate the work that CocoaHeads and NSCoder Chicago are doing. Therefore we won't do things like have short or long-form talks or presentations. In fact we don't meet on days that would conflict with these two meetups, because that's where we'll be on those days. Think of Peer Lab Chicago as office hours for yourself and your friends.  A place where you know you can go to when you want a place to work, or seek help. 

### Do you have a Code of Conduct?

Yes. Our code of conduct is available at [http://peerlabchicago.com/cc](http://peerlabchicago.com/cc).

### Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.

You can find us on Twitter at [@peerLabChicago](https://twitter.com/peerlabchicago).

### I'm not in Chicago. Is there a Peer Lab near me?

There is a list of labs at [peerlab.community](http://peerlab.community). On that site you can also learn more about Peer Labs and find out how to start your own.
